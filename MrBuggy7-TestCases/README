# In this project, I tested the MrBuggy7 programme.

MrBuggy7 is a fictional computer program that is often used as an example in software testing or IT security training. The programme was created specifically for educational purposes and contains a variety of bugs and vulnerabilities that can be used to teach testing and how to find and exploit application vulnerabilities.

The test cases were made in the Jira tool and exported to pdf and xls format.
