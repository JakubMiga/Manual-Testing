In this department, I participated in a multi-day Quality Assurance marathon implemented by GoIT. 

In the implemented marathon, I acquired knowledge of theory, QA responsibilities and practical issues through the projects performed.

QA Marathon syllabus:
/theory/.
- Who is a tester?
- Role of the tester in the team
- Test artefacts (what is a test case and what is its function)
- How to complete a bug report
- Documentation workflow (what happens after the tester has completed the bug report).
- Types of testing
/Practice/
- Working with software: TestReil, Jira
- Two projects: bug reporting, creating test cases, working with documentation


Project 1:
- Working with the TestReil tool
